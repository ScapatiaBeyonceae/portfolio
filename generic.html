									<h1>
									My logic is sound — and not just in code.</h1>
									<p>In 9th Grade, during an English class at Maritzburg College, I noticed a quote on the wall: “The world is 1% what happens to you and 99% how you react to it.” It sparked something that sent me into a very serious attempt at rewiring my own brain - It became my Roman Empire!</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Graduation.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>From that point on, I felt there were two kinds of people: those the world happens to, and those who happen to the world. I chose the latter - confidently, and with very little direction. I believed I could do everything. The only question was: where do I start? I was good at many things, which made it hard to tell what I actually liked versus what I liked being praised for but what I knew is that I’m not driven by titles or noise. I’m driven by mastery, freedom of thought, and meaningful contribution.</p>
								<p>That single quote led me down a deep dive into human psychology, behavior, and motivation. The shift in mindset started a chain reaction that opened my eyes to seeing the world in systems: patterns, pathways, loopholes, constraints. Like Neo in The Matrix, what changed wasn’t my attentiveness - it was the framework around it. The world felt less mysterious and more debuggable.</p>
								<p>I became inevitable and took the red pill - choosing structure over guesswork and graduating with an Honours degree in Computer Science with distinction. The choice was already made; data analytics felt less like a pivot and more like a homecoming.</p>
								<p>Data gave structure to instincts I had relied on for years. SQL, Python, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization using Power BI as well as Tableau weren’t just technical skills; they were tools for clarity. I enjoyed the discipline of turning messy, human reality into something legible without stripping it of meaning. I learned that good analysis isn’t about impressing people with complexity; it’s about making the right thing obvious.</p>
								<p>Professionally, I’ve grown into an analyst who values precision, context, and restraint. I don’t believe every insight needs to be loud to be impactful. Often, the most valuable contribution is the one that quietly shifts a decision, prevents an error, or reframes a question entirely. Along the way, I’ve developed a dry sense of humor about data work because anyone who has ever cleaned a dataset knows humility is not optional.</p>
